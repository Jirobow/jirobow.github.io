## Overview

This is my second commit for the QR code component challenge. Though incomplete, a lot of progress was made in terms of my learning.

### Links

- [Github repository with my solutions](https://github.com/Jirobow/git-mdn-web-docs-tasks)

### Built with

- VS Code (enhanced with Prettier and Path Intellisense extensions)
- Nodejs (v18.17.1) + live-server node app.

### What I learned

How to handle moving-around multiple (nested) HTML elements using a CSS stylesheet, specially with regards to using css display: flex properties.

### Continued development

My main goal moving forward is to actually find out WHY my div box is slightly miss-aligned with its background, with some overlap of a couple of pixels (this is easy to see when checking the box model in inspect mode - see screenshot for more details). I do plan to come back to this project later on to have this issue fixed.

Other planned re-commits for the future:

- Making sure WCAG requirements are met (I haven't tested them yet).

### Screenshots:

### Useful resources

- [Git Tutorial for Beginners: Learn Git in 1 Hour](https://youtu.be/8JJ101D3knE) - Gave me a solid understanding and much more confidence with Git.
- [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) - Provided an easy-to-understand step-by-step path to learning front-end dev, plus this README template.
- [W3schools CSS Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) - Easy to pick-up tutorial with most of the commonly used properties, plus exercises. Concise and full of interactivity, this was a life-saver.
- [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com) - Nothing like a little game to practice, and this one teaches display:flex in CSS like any other.
